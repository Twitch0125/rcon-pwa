# Dead Project
Marking this as archived since I never really plan on going back to this, but I wanna keep my first programming projects around.
I think this might've been a 2nd attempt after the rcon-gui I attempted?

# rcon-pwa

> My dazzling Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
